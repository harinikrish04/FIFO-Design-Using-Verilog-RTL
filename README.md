# FIFO-Design-Using-Verilog-RTL
A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) is a digital buffer that stores data and outputs it in the same order it was received. The first data written is the first read out, like a queue. It helps manage data flow between hardware modules operating at different speeds, ensuring smooth and orderly data transfer.
